In a MapReduce model, users utilize a self-defined map function on mapping workers to process splits of input data, generating set of intermediate key/value pairs and use a reduce function on reducing workers to sort and merge the intermediate values with the same key. The paper also provides some programming model examples and typical implementations of MapReduce that process terabytes of data on thousands of machines. Some refinements of the model, the performance evaluation of the implementation, the use of MapReduce on indexing system within Google, and related and future work are also discussed in the paper. 2 - ProblemThere are large amounts of data to be processed and generated in many real-world tasks. Although most computations are straightforward, in order to improve efficiency, they need to be distributed across thousands of machines due to the enormous amounts of data. The methods that distribute the data, parallelize computations, and handle failures involve large amounts of complicated code. The problem is how to implement those work in a simple and powerful way and make it fault-tolerant even across numerous machines. 3 - SolutionAuthors designed a framework that dividing the parallelization and distribution tasks into Mapping and Reducing phases in general. Mapping tasks and reducing tasks are assigned to idle workers by the master. In the Mapping phase, input data are partitioned into several splits, and those splits can be processed by different machines (mappers) in parallel, generating intermediate key/value pairs that buffered to local disk. In the Reducing phase, reduce workers remotely read intermediate pairs and sort them by the keys so that those with the same key are aggregated together, and then pass the key and the corresponding list of values to the user-defined Reduce function, which return an output appended to an output file for that reduce partition. All the messy details of partitioning, execution scheduling, inter-machine communications, fault-tolerance, and load balancing are hidden in a library and accommodated by the run-time system. This makes the MapReduce interface simple, manageable, and powerful even for programmers without experience about parallel and distributed system. 4 - NoveltyMapReduce is a brand-new solution of distributed computations framework. It is inspired by primitive functions map and reduce in many programming languages. MapReduce is simple and more fault-tolerant, in comparison to many other contemporary parallel processing systems those are also restricted programming models but have only been implemented on smaller scales and leave machine failures to the programmers to handle. The locality optimization, backup task mechanism, and sorting facility of MapReduce have similarities in spirit to other techniques but are extended from different approaches. 5 - EvaluationAuthors evaluated the performance of MapReduce with two example computations running on a large cluster of PCs. One searches for a specific pattern through about one terabyte of data, the other sorts approximately one terabyte of data. The former shows the progress of the grep program in the aspect of data transfer rate. The latter shows how disabling backup tasks can slow down the execution comparing to the normal execution and demonstrated the strengths of machine failures handling. The differences between MapReduce and other existing methods are mostly discussed in terms of principles. In general, MapReduce is simpler (programmer-friendly), more fault-tolerant, extendable than other parallel processing systems. 6 - OpinionIn the Performance section, the measurements of two implementations (search and sort) only focus on the strengths of MapReduce model and weaknesses are barely discussed. Also, it would be better if there were some comparisons with similar parallelization methods towards the same tasks. One of the most convictive parts to me is the Experience section, stating the progresses and enhancements of MapReduce and its wide-ranging applications within Google, especially the large-scale indexing system.

Regular Expression 正则表达式正则表达式常简称为regex。一个regular expression常被成为一种pattern（模式、模板？），用来描述和匹配一系列符合某种规则的字符串。以下是一些基本用法。 1.1 Quantifier 数量限定符注意区别通配符‘*’ Char Description Example ? 表示前面的token出现0或1次 app?le 可匹配 aple(0次)、apple（1次） + 表示前面的token出现1或n次 go+gle 可匹配 gogle（1次）、google、gooogle……（n次) * 表示前面的token出现0或n次 ali(ba)* 可匹配 ali（0次）、aliba（1次）、alibaba……（n次） {n} 表示前面的token固定出现n次 o{2} 可匹配zoo、moon、book……但是Bob不行 {n,} 表示前面的token至少出现n次 {1,}相当于+；{0,}相当于* {m,n} 表示前面的token出现m～n次 As above. Note: 默认为greedy matching，匹配最长的字符串；当?添加在其他任意quantifier后面时，表示lazy matching，匹配最短的字符串。e.g.h.+l matches &#39;hell&#39; in &#39;hello&#39;, greedy.h.+?l matches &#39;hel&#39; in &#39;hello&#39;, lazy. 1.2 其他常用符号 Char Description Comments ^ 字符串starting position ^a 可匹配’alias’，line-based tools中表示每一行的开头 $ 字符串的ending position n$ 可匹配’qq.cn’，line-based tools中表示每一行的结尾 () grouping ali(ba)*中‘ba’是一个tokon . 除了\\n(new-line)之外的任意单个字符 常配合quantifier.+表示1-n个任意字符 \\ 转义符 转右边特殊字符为它本身\\^=^；转右边普通字符为特殊意义\\n=newline；Highest priority | Boolean OR gr(e|a)y 匹配 ‘grey’和’gray’注：由于hexo对markdown的解析还不够完善，此处vertical bar无法成功转义，总是打乱表格，故补充在引用里。 2. grep(Globally search a Regular Expression and Print)2.1 Syntaxgrep [ opt ]... pattern [ file/dir/stdin ]...支持以下三种RegEx引擎-E POSIX扩展正则表达式，ERE (使用除了*之外quantifier时，|时)-G POSIX基本正则表达式，BRE（默认）-P Perl正则表达式，PCRE 2.2 Options &amp; Arguments Options Description -a –text 将binary-file作为文本来进行匹配 -b –byte-offset 在输出行的行首显示offset -c –count 打印每个文件匹配到的行数 -i –ignore-case 忽略大小写 -n –line-number 显示匹配文本所在行的行号 -v –invert-match, 反向匹配，输出不匹配行的内容 -r –recursive 递归匹配 -A n after，除了列出匹配行之外，还列出后面的n行 -B n before，除了列出匹配行之外，还列出前面的n行 –color=auto 将输出中的匹配项设置为自动颜色显示 特殊pattern Description [:digit:] 0-9 [:upper:] A-Z [:lower:] a-z [:alpha:] A-Z, a-z [:alnum:] 0-9, A-Z, a-z [:punct:] punctuation symbol [:graph:] [:alnum:]+[:punct:] [:blank:] [space] and [Tab] [:space:] whitespace: tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, and space.

Learning Scheduling Algorithms for Data Processing Clusters Distributed Systemsa collection of independent computers that appears to the user as a single coherent system. Tanenbaum, 2006 Complex:components are autonomous and collaborative. Design issues: Heterogeneity. Network/hardware/OS/languages are heterogenous; use standard protocols (HTTP) Openness, taken for granted at networking level but not universal at component level; determines whether the system can be extended or re-implemented in various ways; new resource sharing service can be added by clients; key interfaces published; uniform communication mechanisms; Security, might be mutually incompatible security policies, more ways of being attacked comparing to centralised systems; Scalability, size (add more resource), distribution (geo-disperse without degrading), manageability. Scaling up (upgrade resources), scaling out (add new). Techniques: hiding latency (avoid blocking on remote), distribution, replication Failure handling; usually partial, detection difficult and can cascade; must provide high degree of availability. Techniques: detecting/masking failures (retransmitting), design tolerating client, recovery policy, redundancy (database replication) Transparency, ideally user not aware distribution, practically impossible (parts are independently managed and network latency); usually make users aware so that can cope with problems (node crash); Types: hide access/location/migration/replication/concurrency/failure/scaling Quality of Service, reflects the system’s ability to deliver services reliably with a response time/throughput acceptable to users. (e.g. if quality falls then sound/video so degraded that impossible to understand) Centralised (2-tier) and Decentralised (N-tier/P2P) distributed computing systems Homogeneous Cluster computing: largly the same, physically close, highly connected, ONE admin domain Heterogeneous Grid computing: no assumptions about hardware/OS/network, MULTIPLE domains Cloud computing: elastic capacity, pay-per-use, on-demand self service, resources are virtualised Structure of Distributed SystemsThe structure of distributed systems top to bottom: Applications/Services Middleware Operating System Computer and Network Hardware Application/Service (Layer 1) has client-server architecture. A server for a distributed database may act as a client, forwarding requests to different file servers. Three levels: UI, processing, data. In a 2-tier client-server (centralised) architecture, singple logical server mounting indefinite number of clients. Thin-client model, only presentation layer implemented on client, all others on server. simple to deploy and manage the clients heavy processing load on both server and network Fat-client model, some/all of the application processing is locally executed on client. suitable when the capabilities of client system are known in advance more complex than thin, expecially for management of new clients less network traffic new versions have to be installed on all clients In a Multi-tier client-server (decentralised: vertical distribution) architecture, seperate processes execute on different physical machines/servers. Alleviate problems with scalability, potentially offer higher performance. In a peer-to-peer (decentralised: hotizontal distribution) architecture, seperate shares of a complete set of data are operated on several logically-equivalent clients/servers. Attr: processes on peers are all equal; interactions are symmetric; each process acts as both client and server PRO: Resilience; Scalability CON: no-one’s in charge; each peer only knows limited info Middleware (Layer 2) is the software that provides useful building blocks, manages the diverse components (involving diff lang/processors/protocols) and ensure they can communicate and exchange data. OS and hardware (Layer 3 &amp; 4) are platform. Some trivial points: Virtual Machine: VMWare, XenSource Vittual Storage: GFS, HDFS Big data: high-volume, high-velocity, high-variaty; must be converted to knowledge and understanding in order to stimulate scientific discoveries, industry innovations and economic growth. Cloud Computing To developers: no upfront infrastructure investment reduced operating costs through utility pricing elastic on-demand architecture high service availability ease of use To providers: exploit existing data-centre capacity take advantage of economies of scale (available to purchasers of extremely large volumes of hardware and network capacity) Enabled technologies: Virtualization: abstract physical infrastructure, isolated guest OS co-existing on the same computer (see figure below) Virtual storage: GFS, HDFS Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): REpresentational State Transfer(REST); develop applications using existing services, make applications available as services or both Tight Coupling: components difficult to understand in isolation, have many interdependency, difficult to maintain and re-use, cascade changes Loose Coupling: components independent; easier maintainance and re-use Ultility Computing: pay-per-use, on-demand Different types of cloud: IaaS (infrastructure), Amazon Web Services deliver raw computer infrastructure vendors manage networking, hard drives, OS etc. PaaS (platform), Microsoft Azure deliver an application framework hosted framework user can built applications on SaaS (software), Google Mail deliver applications as a service Terminology Machine Images: a template that contains software configuration Instances: different instance types are essentially different hardware archetype Regions: geo areas of the world which instances can be deployed in, each region contains multiple Availability Zones (AZ), low latency network within the same region Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2): a service providing resizable computing capacity in Amazon’s data centres Simple Storage Service (S3): Internet storage, REST and SOAP interfaces for app dev Glacier: low-cost storage service, optimized for infrequently accessed data, e.g. retrievsl times of several hours (achiving research/scientific data etc.) Metrics: CPU utilization, latency, request counts. Some custom app/sys metrics: memory usage, transaction volume, error rate Cloud vendors commonly provide Software Development Kit (SDK) for different languages, hide low-levels from end-users with abstract interface.

Numbers in square brackets indicate marks. 1. lm, glsCorr, glsCorrVar [14](a) Describe predict power of a lm model. Comment model performance over some covariates e.g. time! [2][1] Reasonably poor; fairly low $R^2$ 0.2; poor agreement between observed and fitted [1] Prior to A are underestimated, between A to B are overestimated, post B are underestimated. (b) Three assumptions of lm model; Descibe validity of them. [3][1] Normality assumption, appears to be violated, Shapiro-Wilk $H_0$ NORMAL [1] Constant error variance assumption, no evidence violated, Bresh-Pagan test $H_0$ CONSTANT [1] Independence assumption, clearly violated, correlation shown in $\\text{acf}$ plot &amp; Durbin-Watson test $H_0$ INDEPENDENT, test stats less than 2 (c) Think’bout source of data, other reason of correlation. [1]Realistic reason. (d) Describe mean-var relationships underlying BP test, contrast with that assumed by glsVar. [2][1] Breusch-Pagan Test use $r_i^2 = \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1x_i + \\gamma_i$ to determine the extent of agreement between residual variance and vars $x$, where $r_i^2$ are squared residuals, $\\alpha_0$ and $\\alpha_1$ are estimated in the model. [1] BP test assume the test statistics $NR^2\\sim \\chi^2_p$ in this case degree of freedom p = 1. GLS model assume $r^2_i \\sim N(0,\\sigma^2|\\hat{y_i}|^{2m})$ or $N(0,\\sigma^2e^{2my_i})$ (e) What do BP test and glsVar suggest about the mean-var relationship? [3][1] BP test checked(not constant): No evidence for a linear relationship with squared residuals. [1] glsVar: There appears to be a non-zero power-based relationship. [1] AIC smaller when the power coefficient is fitted, and zero is not a plausible in the gls model. (f) Conclude which model is most defensiable. [3][1] Overall Conclusion: There is no/strong evidence for a change of RespVar over ExpVars. [1] Best fitting model (based on AIC [1], it’s glsCorrVar) exhibits a large/small p-value (0.05) for the relationship. The models which inappropriately ignore something concludes ExpVar is (not) significant. 2. glm for Poisson(OD) [11](a) Relationship impied by glmPois model on RAW and LINK scale. Which is suitable. [3][1] glmPois assumes a nonlinear relationship between RespVar and ExpVars and a linear relationship on log/sqrt scale. [1] Not good for this data; [1] model allow monotonic relationship but function seems to need inflection points. (b) Mean-Var relationships underpins glmPois and glmPoisOD. Which is more realistic. [3][1] glmPois assume fitted mean and residual var are equal. [1] glmPoisOD assume residual var is proportional to fitted mean. $\\text{var} = \\phi \\lambda$ [1] In this case, latter is more realistic since estimate of dispersion parameter $\\hat\\phi=399$ is much larger than 1. (c) Contrast conclusions of glmPois ,glmPoisOD andglsCorrVar, which is most defensiable. Additional methods to improve. [3][1] glmPois and glmPoisOD suggest strong evidence for negative/positive Resp-Exp relationship. ​ glsCorrVar suggest this not well-evidenced, could be sampling variability alone. [1] would use glsCorrVar to base my conclusion on. Because although looks nonlinear (even Poisson-based are barely linear on raw scale), the non-constant error variance and correlation are modelled in errors. [1] smoother based function(splines) to improve the relationship? GEE(Generalized Estimating Equation) much like GLMs but allow non-independence. (d) How to investigate the effects of XXX or XXX on RespVar? If RespVar available at both. [2][2] e.g. Interactions, piecewise linear models, time as a factor variable. 3. glm for Binomial [15](a) Describe fit.logit , including RespVar, linear predictior, random component, link function. [4][1] Linear predictor [1] Link function [1] Intercept and Error term [1] Other β parameters Assuming $y_i \\sim Binomial(n_i,p)$ , where $y_i$ is the no. of observation with XXX out of the $n_i$ observations, and $p$ is the probability of XXX (being caught with fish in stomach), also the RespVar of the model, varying over ExpVars.$$p_i = \\frac{e^{\\eta_i}}{1+e^{\\eta_i}} + \\epsilon_i\\$$Linear predictor is obtained by transforming RespVar by the Link function, which is$$g(p_i)=\\log{(\\frac{p_i}{1-p_i})}=\\eta_i=\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\beta_2x_2+\\beta_3x_3+\\beta_4x_4+\\beta_5x_5$$$\\beta_0$is the intercept parameter (baseline), represents $\\text{female, &lt;2.3m}$ and $\\text{george}$. $\\beta_1$is the coefficient for male (compared with female) $\\beta_2$is the coefficient for &gt; 2.3m (compared with &lt; 2.3m) $\\beta_3$is the coefficient for hancock (compared with george) $\\beta_4$is the coefficient for oklawaha (compared with george) $\\beta_5$is the coefficient for trsfford (compared with george) $\\epsilon_i$ is the random component - the binomial error term (b) Odds of Binomial GLM [2]$$\\text{Odds} = \\frac{p(\\text{success})}{p(\\text{failue})} = \\frac{p_{it}}{1-p_{it}}= e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_1x_1+\\beta_2x_2+\\beta_3x_3+\\beta_4x_4+\\beta_5x_5}$$ (c) Calculate odds use fit.logit.best [2]$$\\text{odds(small,trafford)} = e^{\\beta_0+\\beta_4}=e^{-0.1218-1.3733} = 0.2242262$$ (d) Multiplicative effect between odds for different levels [1][1] For baseline level 0 compared with non-base level n, the odds of presence(success) vs absence(failure) are estimated to change by a factor $e^{\\beta_n}$ (e) Explain Deviance [4][1] Deviance provides a measure of discrepancy between fitted model and Saturated model. The smaller the D, the better the model.$$D = 2[l(\\hat\\beta_{sat},\\phi) - l(\\hat\\beta,\\phi)]$$[1] If model correct, $D \\sim \\chi^2_{n-p-1}$, n observations, p predictors ​ A $\\chi^2$ test ($H_0$ model is correct) will give a large p-value for a good fitting. [1] $\\chi^2$ approximation of D often poor for Binomial GLMs [1] Computing $D$ involves $\\phi$, so if it’s unknown we can’t use the result. (f) adjustment to raw residuals and why [2][1] Adjustment.$$ \\text{Pearson residuals} = \\frac{\\text{raw residual}}{\\hat{\\text{SD}}}=\\frac{y-\\hat{y}}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(y)}}$$ [1] Why. We’d like to see no patterns in Pearson residuals if Mean-Var relationship is appropriate. 4. glm for Multinomial [10](a) Nominal and Ordinal [1]Nominal: Response value categories has no natural order. e.g. Ordinal: The matter of response matters. e.g. (b) Assumptions for multinomial GLM fit.mult [3][1] Independent observations from Multinomial distribution. [1] Linear relationship with covars, on (cumulative) log odds scale. [1] IIA : Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives. Assuming the odds of one outcome vs another does not dependent on what alternative outcomes are available.

[1] To test the validity: ​ Fit a model that does not make it, use a model selection statistics to test between two. General Reasons for using GLM instead of LR: Response Var is not guaranteed to change linearly with Explainatory Vars; Response Var is naturally bounded by some range and LR predictions can produce values outside this range; Errors are unlikely to be normal with constant variance.","link":"/zh-cn/MT5761-revision/"},{"title":"MT4113 Statistic Computing - Revision Syllabus","text":"Revision syllabus for MT4113 by lectures/chapters.

Types of code errors; how to build tests; debugging strategies. [x] Online collaborative programming tools: git repositories, clone, pull, push, commit. ModularizationModular programming！split program into discrete, readable blocks of code so that each block does a small amount. Function Advantages avoid repeating easier to test esaier to update and propagate changes divide and conquer problems Module interfaces passing by value make copies, stored in separate location from original var changes inside function have no aﬀect on var’s value outside inefficient but safer passing by reference directly using original var (location) changes to the variable within function aﬀect its’ value after the function run efficient but dangerous Most 3GLs allow both interfaces; one can specify interfaces for certain parameters in C; Base R does not allow passing by reference. Best practice/concept of Encapsulation pass everything required as an argument pass everything out using return() No global side effects within functions Environment (Workspace?!) Base environment (contains basic packages) Global environment (pkg loaded, var created), “reset” every time reopen R Current environment (environment inside of a function) Scoping Name masking: looks up one level for undefined names(can rewrite predefined var, e.g. pi) R default to the version in most recently loaded pkg/func for same name func use of function independent of any previous (env wiped clean for new use) What’s Dynamic Lookup It only matters when code is executed, rather than created. Design Strategies Top-down (rigid) and bottom-up (iterative) approaches flowcharts for planning and documentation outlines or pseudocode (breaking big task into manageable bits) Coding ConventionsBasically readablity and consistency &lt;– for assignment, = for argument, == for boolean function comments listing purpose, I/O indentation and spacing around operators and after commas lines &lt;80 characters long meaningful names in consistent style Testing and DebuggingType of errors: syntax errors logic errors numerical errors (overflow/underflow/floating point problems) How to build test: what code should produce how does code behave with special case (0, nagetive, NA, gigantic) build test prior to building code (code is created to pass tests) Debugging strategy: Trial and error global arguments and step through func print() object as function progresses Computer arithmetic (lecture 4) [x] How numbers are stored on computers.

[x] Overview of parametric and nonparametric methods for constructing tests and confidence intervals. Contexts include one sample, two sample, ANOVA, multiple regression. [x] Permutation methods – test and interval [x] Randomization methods – test and interval [x] Monte Carlo tests; Monte Carlo methods [x] Bootstrap – nonparametric (including balanced bootstrap) and parametric. Percentile confidence intervals. Traditional Par and Non-par MethodTraditional Parametric method, specify PDF for population is known, $f(\\theta) \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$; distribution of test statistic $T(x)$; Problems: result variant to transformation; bias correction. Traditional Non-parametric method, avoid fully specifying $f()$; e.g. Wilcoxon Signed Rank test: $f()$ is symmetric about some median m; $T(X)$ is specified Cons: Wilcoxon e.g. require to formulate $H_0$ in terms of median; Less powerful than a t-test when parametric assumptions met Computer-intensive Statistical MethodAvoid fully specifying either $f()$ and/or $T()$, e.g. Permutation-based approach Randomization-based approach Monte-Carlo-based version of t test (avoid $T()$, but not $f(\\theta)$) Par and Non-Par Bootstrap CI (avoid $T()$, $f(\\theta)$ depends) Permutation MethodsAssume $x_i$ is symmetric about $\\mu_0$. Given 12 obs., there are $2^{12} = 4096$ ways (permutaions). $p$-value is the proportion of that $|\\bar{X}|$ greater then observed $|\\bar{x}|$, how extreme the observed mean is. e.g. 48 out of 4096 are as extreme - p = 48/4096 = 0.012 Permutation tests pick $H-0$ and $T(X)$ under $H-0$ all permutation are equally likely calculate the $p$-value (proportion as extreme) free to choose whatever test statistic e.g. median, trimmed mean, t-stat, etc. readily extends to other simuation e.g. two-sample, ANOVA, multi regression Permutation CI Find the set of $\\mu_0$ such that $H_0: \\mu = \\mu_0$ is not rejected Pros - widely applicable; produce exact result; no specific distribution assumption for population; no analytic distribution of test statistic. Cons - each permutation must be equally likely (or prob is known); hard to program; can be prohibitively intensive for large sample size. Randomization MethodsRamdomization is like permutation, except that only random subset of all permutations. e.g. randomly assign $|x_i-\\mu_0|$ to each Compared with Permutation Methods Pros - all pros of it plus; easier to code; number of randomization is fixed rather than $2^{n}$ Cons - each permutation must be equally likely (or prob is known); results vary. Monte-Carlo TestsMonte-Carlo tests is a generalization of randomization test to include parametric distribution. Algorithm as Set population distribution $f()$ or $f(\\theta)$ and $H_0$ Simulate a dataset under $H_0$ and calculate $T(X)$ (repeat 999 times) Add $T(x)$ of sample data quantile method - calc $p$-value (proportion of $T(X)$ as extreme or more than the one of sample data $T(x)$) Pros - Can be more flexible than randomization, par or non-par; no analytic distribution of test statistic; can cope with non-iid data. Cons(compare to permutation) - need to extimate parameters for par; results vary. BootstrapBootstrapping simulations can be Parametric, simulate from a distribution that properties based on sample data (no iid assumption) Non-parametric, simulate by resampling with replacement from sample data (from Empirical DF) Percentile Method, 95% CI given by 2.5% and 97.5% percentile of the $\\mu$ set. Pros Simple, general and robust, Cons poor performance when underlying distribution is very skewed or estimator is very biased generally, only asymptotically exact as $B$ and $n \\to \\infty$ $f()$ assumption and iid assumption are respectively pro and con for Par and Non-par Bootstrapping. General Monte Carlo MethodMonte Carlo Methods are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to generate numerical results. Used for Inference, (computer-intensive stats, e.g. MC test, Bootstrap, Bayesian stats) Optimization, (later) Stochastic Numerical Integration (compared to Deterministic one!) Optimization methods (lect 9, 10, 11)An understanding of how the methods work, ability to reproduce the algorithms and suggest which might work best in case studies, pros and cons, which to use when. An understanding of what the R functions nls, optimize and optim do. [x] Components of optimization [x] Outline of approaches: graphical, analytic, brute force, iterative: “basic”, calculus-based, stochastic [x] Systematic: Line and grid searches [x] For iterative approaches: convergence, convergence order, stopping rules, robustification [x] Bisection; golden section [x] Newton’s method – univariate, multivariate [x] Gauss-Newton [x] The EM algorithm. [x] Stochastic optimization: optimizing stochastic functions; stochastic search methods. Blind random search, localized random search, simulated annealing. [x] Not examinable: tabu methods and genetic algorithms. Why optimization? non-linear Least-squares problems Maximum Likelihood find CI via test inversion Minimizing risk in Bayesian decision analysis Components of Optimization Objective function: what we want to maximize/minimize, e.g. logLik for ML, $(y-\\hat{y})^2$ for GLS Criteria: Constraints on parameters Stopping Rule(s): desired accuracy/maximum iterations Approaches 优化途径 Graphical - esay; but can’t quantify error, hard for multivariate problems Analytic - aka differentiate func then set differential to zero; solution exact; but there’s often no analytic solution! Brute force - line/grid search (for univariate/multivariate problems); reliable, with known error; inefficient: require numerous calculation dependes on accuracy ($\\epsilon$), hard for multivariate space; ‘Brute force’ could be used to find starting value for other methods to refine Iterative methods “basic”: plotting, line or grid searches Calculus-based (lect 11), Newton, Gauss-Newton Stochastic (lect 12) General Iterative Algorithm Start iteration $t=0$, initial guess $x^0$ Next iteration $t=t+1$, improved guess $x^t = f(x^{t-1})$, using an updating equation Evaluate whether new guess is sufficiently accurate, using a stopping rule If yes, stop and return $x^ = x^t$ and optimized objective function $g(x^)$ If no, go back to 2 or consider whether to give up (report no convergence) Bisection SearchTake finding root of $g’(x) = 0$ as an example. Start with initial interval $[a_0, b_0]$, and $g’(a_0)g’(b_0)&lt;0$, and systematically shrink the interval half by once. Golden Section Search More efficient (converge more quickly), as an extension of bisection method that takes andvantage of the Golden Ratio. ConvergenceEach iteration produces an answer closer to the optimum, we gradually converge on the solution we want. Convergence order is an index of how fast it converges. Convergence criterion serves as stopping rules, two main types, absolute and relative Absolute: stop when $|{x^t - x^{t-1}|} &lt; \\epsilon$, max tolerance. Problems: regardless of the size of the numbers, e.g. err of 0.1 is usually more important when $x^\\ast$ is 0.5 than it is 50,000 Relative: $\\frac{|x^t - x^{t-1}|}{|x^{t-1}|} &lt; \\epsilon$, max proportional tolerance. Robustification Use more numerically stable operation e.g. use $a+\\frac{b-a}{2}$ instead of $\\frac{a+b}{2}$ “good enough” convergence (helps when $x^t$ close to zero) $$\\frac{|x^t-x^{t-1}|}{|x^{t-1}|+\\epsilon} &lt; \\epsilon$$ stop anyway after $N$ iteration, whether convergence achieved or not stop if no converging over several iterations, restart somewhere else Global optimum may not be bracketed at the beginning! or even if bracket it, there may be multiple optima, you may not turn out getting the best one. Newton’s Method (univariate)Also called “Newton-Raphson Method” Iterative, numerical technique for optimization, based on linear approximation with Taylor Series. Think of it as using Successive tangent lines! RationaleApproximate $g’(x^\\ast)$ by linear Taylor series expansion at $x^t$$$g’(x^\\ast) \\approx g’(x^t) + (x^\\ast-x^t)g’’(x^t) = 0$$ Re-arranging gives$$x^\\ast \\approx x^t - \\frac{g’(x^t)}{g’’(x^t)}$$ Here requires that $g’(x)$ is continuously differentiable, and $g’’(\\ast)\\ne 0$ So, the updaing equation is$$x^{t-1} = x^t - \\frac{g’(x^t)}{g’’(x^t)}$$ Algorithm define objective function $g(x)$ and convergence criterion tolerance $\\epsilon$ start iteration $t=0$, set $x^0$, calculate $g(x^0)$. next iteration $t=t+1$, update $x^{t+1} = x^t - g’(x^t)/g’’(x^t)$, calculate $g(x^{t+1})$. evaluate whether convergence criteria are met. if met, return $x^\\ast = x^t$ and exit; otherwise, return to step 3. Summary of Newton’s Can converge etremely rapidly - convergence order $\\beta=2$ but, may not converge at all, depending on shape of $g’(x)$ Can easily get stuck in local optima Newton’s Method (multivariate) Objective function is $g(\\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is a vector of $n$ parameters $\\nabla$ and $\\nabla^2$ is the first and second derivative (gradient and Hessian) $\\Delta$ is the vector of each direction (for one step), $\\theta_{1} = \\theta_0 + \\Delta$ $$\\nabla^2 g(\\theta) \\times \\Delta = - \\nabla g(\\theta)$$ where $\\nabla^2g(\\theta)$ is an $n \\times n$ matrix; $\\Delta$ is a $1 \\times n$ vactor; ​ $\\nabla g(\\theta)$ is an $n$ by $n\\times 1$ vector. Algorithm Pseudocode set objective function $g(\\theta)$ and convergence tolerance $\\epsilon$ chose starting $\\theta_0$ calculate $g(\\theta_0)$ $g’(\\theta) = \\nabla$ $g’’(\\theta) = \\nabla^2$ $\\nabla^2 g(\\theta)\\Delta = - \\nabla g(\\theta)$ , solve for $\\Delta$ $\\theta_{1} = \\theta_0 + \\Delta$ Gauss-Newton Method (multivariate)Iterative procedure for extimating parameters of nonlinear least-square problems(GLS). Objective function is always the sum of square of residuals. Only first order derivatives required (advantage over Newton’s) Rationale Linearise the regression with a 1st order Taylor series evaluated at $\\theta^0$ re-arrange in the form of linear regression $$\\begin{aligned}f(x,\\theta) - f(x,\\theta^0) &amp;= \\sum_j (\\theta_j - \\theta^0_j)\\frac{df} {d\\theta_j}\\bigg|_{\\theta^0} \\&amp;\\equiv \\sum_j \\gamma_j\\omega_j\\end{aligned}$$ where $\\gamma_j = \\theta_j-\\theta_j^0$ corresponds to the unknown parameter $\\omega_j = \\frac{df}{d\\theta_j}\\Big|_{\\theta^0}$ corresponds to the known covariate Algorithm start with $i=0$, set initial parameter $\\theta^0$ estimate $\\gamma$:$$\\gamma^1 = (W^{0T}W^0)^{-1} \\bullet W^{0T}z^0$$ update $\\theta^1 = \\theta^0 + \\gamma^1$ re-evaluate $W$ and $z$ at $\\theta^1$ if met, return $\\theta$; if not go to step 2. Summary of Newton and Gauss-NewtonNewton’s Method Any objective functions require 1st and 2nd derivatives Uni and Multivariate case Gauss-Newton Method Objective function always sum of square of resid require only 1st derivatives for Multivariate non-linear least-square problem Stochastic MethodsPrevious methods are all deterministic methods. OBJ function can be evaluated exactly; algorithm is deterministic - i.e. given same data and start point, it takes same path to same solution. Why Stochastic Necessary to deal with stochastic func Can be used for discrete problem do better in finding global rather than local! some Cons; faster than brute force but slower than deterministic. Want a good solution or the best? Stochastic optimization methods use random variables. Two variaties below can overlap: Optimizing stochastic functions (OBJ function contains random noise); step size decrease, accuracy increase as iteration number increase Optimization algorithm with random search (search methods contains random element); converge faster, improve robustness when global optimum hard to find. Stochastic search Algorithm Blind random search - generate new candidate from some chosen PDF Localized random search - generate new candidate from some chosen PDF (depends on current candidate); step neither fixed(brute force) nor full random (blind) Simulated annealing - many variants, work well but sloooow Consequences of Stochasticity Evaluation of OBJ func (and its gradient) no longer accurate grid search methods may pick wrong point; iterative methods may fail to converge Accuracy can be improved by repeat eval, err decrease with $1/\\sqrt{N}$ Reproducibility and graphics (lect 12, 13, 14)Reproducible research [x] What is it and why is it a good idea [x] Ways to achieve reproducibility (or fail to achieve reproducibility) [x] Key components of reproducible research [x] Not examinable: specifics of R Markdown.
